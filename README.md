Leaflet Challenge Assignment 15

For this assignment the requirement was to visualise an earthquake dataset by doing following steps:

    • Visit the USGS GeoJSON website and choose a dataset to visualise.
    • Use the URL of the dataset to pull in the JSON data for the visualisation.
    • Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
    • Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with       greater depth should appear darker in colour.
    • Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
    • Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
